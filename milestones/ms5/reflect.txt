This milestone is the last project for this OOP semester.This is a mixture of all the things that I learned throughout this course including encapsulation,abstraction,polymorphism and inheritence.Honeslty,when I see the output of this I was really amazed that I did complete this whole project and it was really interesting to know how the valet parking will work on coding.I don't think so I faced any difficulty in completing this project.So this was the good ending of the project.
