                                                           REFLECTION FOR W9
In this workshop, I learned about that abstract class and pure virtual functions.There are two types of classes:abstract class and concrete class.An abstract class is the base class that defines the interface,whereas the concrete class is the derived class that do implementation of interface.
The main component of abstarct class is pure virtual function. The pure virtual function has no implementations.When we put the virtual function =0 then it becomes the pure virtual function.
I declared these two pure virtual functions in this workshop i.e. 
            virtual void draw(std::ostream& os) const = 0;//takes the reference to ostream
		virtual void getSpecs(std::istream& is) = 0;//takes the reference to istream
I also got to know about how to declare the abstarct class in .h files.
              class LblShape : public Shape {
I declared the LblShape as abstract class
The declaration of concrete class takes the form like this:
               class Line :public LblShape //inherits the LblShape class
               class Rectangle :public LblShape //inherits the LblShape class
