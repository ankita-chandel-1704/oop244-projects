Reflect


In this workshop  we learned and used basic topic of c++ like functions and adding a file , and its content to the code 
then we read the value frm code and compared it using different functions in different modules and programmed the code accordingly 
for every condition there would be a different output and also added the output at the end , checking if  the input matches the condition 
if not then dislaying error, we used flags in form of bools and pointers for storing fnction.
